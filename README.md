[TUGraz-INFO2-python-project](https://online.tugraz.at/tug_online/ee/ui/ca2/app/desktop/#/slc.tm.cp/student/courses/239351?$ctx=design=ca;lang=de&$scrollTo=toc_overview)

Technologies used:
- NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib
Classifiers used:
- Dummy Classifier, Support Vestor Classifiers, Logistic Regression Classifiers, kNN

Results were compared using [jupyter](https://github.com/tparkhomenko/python-assignment-2-Supervised-Machine-Learning/blob/master/test_classes-2.ipynb)

Assignment 1:
The overall goal of Assignment 1 is to practice the basics of object-oriented programming. 
In this assignment, you will create a system for exploring datasets. 
The system is able to load and store a dataset, and it includes functionality for exploring the dataset, such as plotting columns and calculating simple metrics.

Assignment 2:
The overall goal of Assignment 2 is twofold: 
(1) You will further practice object-oriented programming, and 
(2) you will have the opportunity to gain first 
experience with supervised machine learning.
In this assignment, you will build on the code that you wrote in Assignment 1, adding functionality for supervised machine learning (specifically, 
for classification) to the system. You will then use your system to predict the target values (i.e., the presence or absence of a disease) of your chosen 
dataset and report your results in a technical report.
